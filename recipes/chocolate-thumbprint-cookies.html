            <p>These cookies are a classic. They're easy to make and always a hit. They're great for holiday parties, but you can make them any time of year. They're also a great way to use up leftover jam.</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. Shape dough into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Flatten each ball to 1/2-in. thickness. Make an indentation in the center of each cookie with your thumb. Fill each indentation with jam. Bake 10-12 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and enough water to achieve drizzling consistency. Drizzle over cookies. Yield: 4 dozen.</li>
